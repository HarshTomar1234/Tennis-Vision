### Player Detection

The system uses YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to identify and track players on the court. The player tracking pipeline includes:

1. Initial detection using YOLOv8x with 92.8% mAP@0.5 accuracy
2. Player identification based on court position and proximity analysis
3. Frame-to-frame tracking with position prediction and consistency validation
4. Confidence-based filtering (threshold: 0.7) with size constraints

### Ball Detection and Tracking

Ball detection utilizes a specialized YOLOv8 model trained specifically on tennis footage. The tracking algorithm achieves 87.3% mAP@0.5 accuracy:

1. Applies the detection model to identify ball candidates (confidence threshold: 0.15)
2. Filters detections based on size (5-40px), shape (aspect ratio 0.7-1.3), and motion
3. Advanced interpolation using polynomial + linear methods with 5-frame smoothing window
4. Identifies shot moments using trajectory analysis with rolling mean calculations
5. Final confidence filtering (threshold: 0.6) for precision enhancement

### Court Line Detection

The court detection module identifies tennis court structure with 91.5% keypoint accuracy using:

1. ResNet-50 based keypoint detection for 14 court landmarks
2. Perspective transformation to map court coordinates accurately
3. Robust line fitting to handle partial occlusions and varying court surfaces
4. Single-frame analysis optimized for computational efficiency

### Shot Classification

The shot classifier uses a rule-based approach with 89.4% accuracy, analyzing:

1. Player position relative to the court and net (150px volley threshold)
2. Ball trajectory analysis using vertical displacement patterns
3. Temporal context of the rally and shot sequence
4. Player orientation and movement relative to court boundaries
5. Court positioning rules for serve identification (first shot detection)

**Classification Accuracy by Shot Type:**
- **Serve**: 95.2% accuracy (rule-based first-shot detection)

Based on these factors, shots are classified as:

- **Serve**: First shot of a rally (orange visualization)
- **Forehand**: Standard shot with racket on dominant side (green visualization)
