## üèè Cricket-Specific Features

### Shot Classification System
The system recognizes these cricket shots:

| Shot Type | Description | Color Code |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Six** | Ball crosses boundary without bouncing | Red |
| **Four** | Ball reaches boundary after bouncing | Green |
| **Drive** | Straight or off-side attacking shot | Green |
| **Cut** | Shot played square on off-side | Blue |
| **Pull** | Cross-batted shot to leg-side | Orange |
| **Sweep** | Shot played to leg-side off spin | Cyan |
| **Hook** | Shot played to leg-side off pace | Purple |
| **Flick** | Wrist shot to leg-side | Yellow |
| **Loft** | Aerial shot over fielders | Magenta |
| **Defensive** | Defensive stroke | Gray |
| **Single** | Shot resulting in one run | White |
| **Dot Ball** | No run scored | Dark Gray |

### Player Role Detection
- **Batsman** (Green): Primary striker
- **Bowler** (Blue): Ball delivery
- **Wicket Keeper** (Red): Behind stumps
- **Fielders** (Cyan): Field positions

### Cricket Statistics
- **Runs Scored**: Total runs in the analyzed period
- **Balls Faced**: Number of deliveries
- **Strike Rate**: (Runs/Balls) √ó 100
- **Ball Speed**: Delivery speed in km/h
- **Shot Power**: Relative power of shots (0-100%)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Cricket Ball Detection
Unlike tennis balls, cricket balls are:
- Smaller and harder to track
- Red/white colored (different from tennis yellow)
- Move faster with more unpredictable trajectories
- Often obscured by players

Our cricket ball tracker includes:
- Enhanced interpolation for fast-moving objects
- Cricket-specific event detection (deliveries, shots, boundaries)
- Improved confidence thresholds for small objects

### Cricket Pitch Detection
Cricket pitches have unique characteristics:
- 22-yard pitch length
- Creases and wickets
- Circular/oval boundary
- Different surface colors (grass field, dirt pitch)

The pitch detector identifies:
- Pitch boundaries (22-yard strip)
- Creases (batting and bowling)
- Wicket positions
- Boundary circle

### Mini Cricket Pitch Visualization
The mini pitch provides:
- Realistic cricket field appearance (green grass, brown pitch)
- Proper cricket field proportions
- Boundary circle representation
- Player positions with role-specific colors
- Ball trajectory with cricket-specific styling

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Shot Direction Analysis
The system determines shot direction:
- **Straight**: Down the ground
- **Off Side**: Right side (for right-handed batsman)
- **Leg Side**: Left side (for right-handed batsman)  
- **Behind Wicket**: Behind the batsman

### Event Detection
Automatically detects:
- **Deliveries**: When bowler releases ball
- **Shots**: When batsman hits ball
- **Boundaries**: When ball reaches boundary
- **Wickets**: Potential dismissals (basic detection)

### Real-time Statistics
- Live updating scoreboard
- Shot-by-shot analysis
- Performance metrics
- Visual shot history (last 6 balls)

## üîß Customization

### Adjusting Cricket Parameters
Edit `cricket_constants/__init__.py`:
```python
# Modify field dimensions
BOUNDARY_RADIUS_MIN = 55  # Smaller grounds
BOUNDARY_RADIUS_MAX = 90  # Larger grounds

# Adjust shot classification thresholds
BOUNDARY_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD = 200  # Boundary shot distance
AGGRESSIVE_SHOT_THRESHOLD = 150    # Aggressive shot distance
```

### Custom Shot Types
Add new shot types in `utils/cricket_shot_classifier.py`:
```python
self.SHOT_TYPES = {
    'REVERSE_SWEEP': 'Reverse Sweep',
    'SWITCH_HIT': 'Switch Hit',
    # Add more shots...
}
```

### Visual Styling
Modify colors and styling in `mini_cricket_pitch.py`:
```python
# Change field colors
green_bg[:, :] = [34, 139, 34]  # Field green
pitch_color = (101, 67, 33)     # Pitch brown
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### For Better Accuracy
1. **Use high-resolution videos** (1080p or higher)
2. **Ensure good lighting** in cricket footage
3. **Stable camera angles** work best
4. **Clear view of pitch** improves detection

### For Faster Processing
1. **Reduce video resolution** for testing
2. **Use GPU acceleration** if available
3. **Adjust detection confidence** thresholds
4. **Enable stub caching** for development

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Local Deployment
```bash
# Run locally
python cricket_main.py
```

### Web Deployment
The system can be adapted for web deployment using:
- **Streamlit** for quick web interface
- **Flask/Django** for full web application
- **Docker** for containerized deployment

### Cloud Deployment
Deploy on:
- **AWS EC2** with GPU instances
- **Google Cloud Platform** with AI/ML services
- **Azure** with computer vision services
