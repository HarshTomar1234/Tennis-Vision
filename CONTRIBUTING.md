- Provide clear, detailed descriptions
- Include system information and error logs

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the code style guidelines below
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest tests/
   
   # Check code style
   black --check .
   flake8 .
   ```

4. **Commit and push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use descriptive titles and descriptions
   - Reference related issues
   - Include screenshots/videos for visual changes

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 standards
- Use Black for code formatting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use type hints where appropriate

```python
# Good
def detect_players(frame: np.ndarray, confidence: float = 0.7) -> List[Dict]:
    """Detect players in the given frame."""
    pass

# Bad
def detect_players(frame, confidence=0.7):
    pass
```

### Documentation

- Use docstrings for all functions and classes
- Follow Google-style docstrings
- Include parameter types and return types
- Add usage examples for complex functions

```python
def track_ball(frames: List[np.ndarray], model_path: str) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Track ball positions across multiple frames.
    
    Args:
        frames: List of video frames as numpy arrays
        model_path: Path to the trained ball detection model
        
    Returns:
        List of (x, y) coordinates for ball positions
        
    Example:
        >>> frames = load_video_frames("match.mp4")
        >>> positions = track_ball(frames, "models/ball_model.pt")
        >>> print(f"Ball detected at {len(positions)} positions")
    """
    pass
```

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(tracker): add ball trajectory smoothing
fix(detection): resolve false positive filtering
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functions
- Use descriptive test names
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Mock external dependencies

```python
def test_ball_detection_with_valid_frame():
    """Test ball detection with a valid input frame."""
    frame = create_test_frame_with_ball()
    detections = detect_ball(frame)
    assert len(detections) == 1
    assert detections[0]['confidence'] > 0.5
```
